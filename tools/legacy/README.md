# Legacy Tools

This folder stores research/diagnostic scripts that are not part of the
primary "Battlezone Gold Extractor" pipeline.

Moved here to keep `tools/` focused on production workflow:

- `analyze_blocks.py`
- `apply-hopper-blender-material.py`
- `build-hopper-texture-baseline.py`
- `classify-signatures.ps1`
- `find-model-texture-candidates.py`
- `inventory.ps1`
- `mare-material-link-analysis.py`
- `model-chunk-index.py`
- `split-model-components.py`

These scripts remain available for reverse-engineering deep dives.
